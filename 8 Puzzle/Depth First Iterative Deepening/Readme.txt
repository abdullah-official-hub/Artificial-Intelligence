
	Depth First with Iterative Deepening

	Prerequisite :

	1. Random Grid (Source Grid) must be given in 'GivenGrid.txt' for which you want optimal Solution. '-1' for blank.
	2. Ideal Grid (Target Grid) must be given in 'IdealGrid.txt'.

	Working of Code :

	1. Returns the optimal solution in Specific Depth.
	2. Maximum efficient time by avoiding the nodes which are already Visited.
	3. Ask for manual Depth to user. And starting searching till given depth.
	4. If the solution is found, then Graphically represent the moves one by one and save them also in file 'BlankMovement.txt'.
	5. Display the Total Numbers of explored Nodes.
	6. Delete the useless nodes time by time to make the Time Complexity Better.
